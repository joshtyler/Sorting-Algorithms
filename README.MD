#Sorting-Algorithms

This project comprises of an implementation of hash table, and selection sort algorithms in order to explore different ways of storing and retrieving data.

The results are summarised in the report in the docs folder.

![Data collected from project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshtyler/Sorting-Algorithms/master/docs/graphs/Selection_Sort_Points.png "Selection sort graph generated")

## Notes

The project is presented as a single Visual Studio 2013 project, comprising of several programs.

The main two programs are Hashing and Selection_sort, which implement a hash table and data storage using selection sort into an array, respectively.

Several helper programs and scripts are also included which generate data for test, and collate the results in a suitable format for generating graphs. This approach is used because the assignment had strict restrictions on what could be included in the main two programs.

## Known problems and limitations
The main two programs would ideally be split into multiple files, but the assignement stated only one file could be submitted for each.

The debug method is also un-necessarily complex. It was developed this way as a learning exercise.
